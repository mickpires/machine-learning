    "variance. This means that if we split the training data into two parts\n",
    "at random, and fit a decision tree to both halves, the results that we\n",

    "variance will yield similar results if applied repeatedly to distinct\n",

    "## More bagging\n",
    "\n",
    "Bagging typically results in improved accuracy\n",
    "over prediction using a single tree. Unfortunately, however, it can be\n",
    "difficult to interpret the resulting model. Recall that one of the\n",
    "advantages of decision trees is the attractive and easily interpreted\n",
    "diagram that results.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, when we bag a large number of trees, it is no longer\n",
    "possible to represent the resulting statistical learning procedure\n",
    "using a single tree, and it is no longer clear which variables are\n",
    "most important to the procedure. Thus, bagging improves prediction\n",
    "accuracy at the expense of interpretability.  Although the collection\n",
    "of bagged trees is much more difficult to interpret than a single\n",
    "tree, one can obtain an overall summary of the importance of each\n",
    "predictor using the MSE (for bagging regression trees) or the Gini\n",
    "index (for bagging classification trees). In the case of bagging\n",
    "regression trees, we can record the total amount that the MSE is\n",
    "decreased due to splits over a given predictor, averaged over all $B$ possible\n",
    "trees. A large value indicates an important predictor. Similarly, in\n",
    "the context of bagging classification trees, we can add up the total\n",
    "amount that the Gini index  is decreased by splits over a given\n",
    "predictor, averaged over all $B$ trees."

    "\n",
    "The approaches to machine learning are many, but are often split into two main categories. \n",
    "In *supervised learning* we know the answer to a problem,\n",
    "and let the computer deduce the logic behind it. On the other hand, *unsupervised learning*\n",
    "is a method for finding patterns and relationship in data sets without any prior knowledge of the system.\n",

    "\n",
    "Another way to categorize machine learning tasks is to consider the desired output of a system.\n",
    "Some of the most common tasks are:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Classification: Outputs are divided into two or more classes. The goal is to   produce a model that assigns inputs into one of these classes. An example is to identify  digits based on pictures of hand-written ones. Classification is typically supervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Regression: Finding a functional relationship between an input data set and a reference data set.   The goal is to construct a function that maps input data to continuous output values.\n",
